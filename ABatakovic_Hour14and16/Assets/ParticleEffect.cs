/*
 1) doubled the duration and start lifetime from 5 to 10.
 2) I changed the start speed to 15, now with this change and the previous one the particals travel a lot higher into the air than before.
 3) For start size I used the curve editor to make them start big and get smaller as their life nears the end.
 4) I changed the start color so it is a gradient from red to yellow.
 5) Under Shape, I changed the radius and angle for the cone emitter.
