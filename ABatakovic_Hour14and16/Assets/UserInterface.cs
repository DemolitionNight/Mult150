/*
I gave my game a title and a subtitle/simple desccription and changed the font, size, color, and placement/anchors for them.
I changed the color of my button and made it so only the boarder shows while the inside is transparanet. 
I changed the font style, size, and color of the text inside the button.
I also gave the button a different color when highlighted/pressed, it's interesting to see how the color i picked for the button mixes with the transition color.
